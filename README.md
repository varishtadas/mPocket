**UI Scripting Assessment**
Create a complete setup for programmatically running a series of tests on the Amazon web shop.
Write 4 simple tests in a test automation suite.
1. Search for a product. Verify the list.
2. Add a product to the cart. Verify that the added product is in the cart.
3. Increase the number of items in the cart to 10. Verify that the total price changed.
4. Remove a product from the cart. Verify the change.

**Key Points to Note:**

● Your solution should be re-runnable an infinite number of times.
● Your test suite should contain a reusable “setup” script that runs before each test
suite. (Guarantees that the web shop cart is in a predictable state.)
● Your test suite should also contain a reusable “teardown” script that restores the
web shop cart to its original state.
● Submit scripts, a list of dependencies and instructions on how to set up, recreate
and run the complete test automation environment.
